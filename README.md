# Bank Client Churn Analysis 

### Project Overview
This project aims to provide actionable insights on the client churn of a bank. By analyzing different aspects of the data, we seek to identify trends, key factors influencing client churn, make data-backed recommendations, and assist the company in retaining more clients.

### Data Cleaning Process
I first loaded the dataset into excel, then converted it from a csv to a xlsx file for better viewing. The next step was to remove duplicates and blanks, then I did some column formatting and ensured that the correct data types were used. The last step was to do a thorough spell check on all the columns.


### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring our dataset to answer these questions:
1. What are the genders and ages of the clients who've left the bank?
2. In which countries are we losing most of our clients, and in which countries are we retaining most of our clients?
3. What were the card types of the clients who've left the bank?
4. What percentage of the clients who've complained, eventually ended up leaving the bank?
